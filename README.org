This is a template for creating [[http://www.tads.org/][TADS 3]] games, based on instructions in [[http://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/gsg/creatingyourfirsttads3project.htm][Getting Started in TADS 3]]

In order to make a real game from this template, you should at a minimum do the following:

1 - Change the contents of the CHANGEME.t file according to your tastes.  Your game program should go here.

2 - Rename CHANGEME.t to whatever you want your game to be called, but retaining the .t extension.

3 - In the Makefile, change the value of GAME_FILENAME_PREFIX from CHANGME to whatever you set it to in step 2 above, without the .t extension.

In addition, other options in the Makefile may be changed, deleted, or modified as you see fit.

To compile your game, just type "make".  The result should be a file named whatever you set your GAME_FILENAME_PREFIX to in step 3 above, with a .t3 extension.

Some intermediate files will be generated in the "obj" directory (or whatever directories you set T3_SYMBOL_DIRECTORY and T3_OBJECT_DIRECTORY to in the Makefile).  You can ignore them, but if you want to delete them along with the compiled game file type "make clean".
